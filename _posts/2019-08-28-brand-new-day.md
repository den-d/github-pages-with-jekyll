This is the day when my first blog post on GitHub is born. Great day should I say.
It seems to be sunny and clear weather. So I'm a little bit confused about today's activities.
It's really hard to stop exploring GitHub. I feel like getting addicted to all this awesome possibilities
provided by the platform, and although I don't know a thing about people who had created this tech mirracle,
it seems that i LOVE'em. Realy. It's unbelievable...
Nevertheless, last summer days shouldn't be spoiled by sitting in the concrete box. I hope GitHub will be still here, 
when i return from my short, couple of days, country trip. See you soon, my new obssession.

Sincresly yours,
Den D
